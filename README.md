Unemployment surged during Covid-19, presenting a compelling case for data analysis. Join me as I break down my approach to this critical issue

🎯 Objective:

Analyze India's unemployment trends to uncover insights for policymakers and businesses.

🛠️ Tools:

• Python for data processing
• Pandas for manipulation
• Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
• Jupyter Notebooks for documentation

🪜 Steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather unemployment rates from reliable sources

2. Preprocessing: Clean and structure the dataset

3. Exploratory Analysis: Identify patterns and anomalies

4. Time Series Modeling: Forecast future trends

5. Correlation Analysis: Explore factors influencing unemployment

6. Visualization: Create compelling charts to communicate findings

📊 Expected Results:

• Historical unemployment patterns
• Covid-19 impact quantification
• Regional disparities identification
• Sector-wise unemployment breakdown

🧗‍♂️ Potential Hurdles:

• Data quality and consistency issues
• Accounting for informal sector employment
• Interpreting seasonal variations
• Factoring in demographic shifts
